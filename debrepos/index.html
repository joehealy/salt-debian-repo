    <h1>Debian Salt Packages</h1>

    <p>This server contains packages for debian squeeze, wheezy and sid.</p>

    <p>For squeeze, you will need to enable the debian backports
      repository as well as the debian.saltstack.com repository. To do so,
      add the following to /etc/apt/sources.list or a file in
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d:</p>

    <pre>
deb http://debian.saltstack.com/debian squeeze-saltstack main
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main contrib non-free
    </pre>

    For wheezy, the following line is needed:

    <pre>
deb http://debian.saltstack.com/debian wheezy-saltstack main
    </pre>

    For sid, the following line is needed:

    <pre>
deb http://debian.saltstack.com/debian unstable main
    </pre>

    <p>The packages have been signed with a key available from
      <a href="http://debian.saltstack.com/debian-salt-team-joehealy.gpg.key">http://debian.saltstack.com/debian-salt-team-joehealy.gpg.key</a>.</p>

    <p>This can be imported with:</p>

    <pre>
wget -O - http://debian.saltstack.com/debian-salt-team-joehealy.gpg.key|apt-key add -
    </pre>

    <p>Notes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>These packages will be backported from the packages in debian
	unstable. This means that the packages will be uploaded to unstable
	first and then backported over the next day or so.</li>
      <li>These packages will be tracking the released versions of salt
	rather than maintaining a stable fixed feature set. If a fixed version
	is what you desire, then either pinning or manual installation may be
	more appropriate for you.</li>
      <li>The version numbering and backporting process should provide clean
	upgrade paths between debian versions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding these, please email the mailing
      list or look for me on irc as joehh.</p>
